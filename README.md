# Prettify JSON

The script gets path of a file containing JSON data and prints
the data in a convenient format.

# Quickstart

The script requires Python v3.5. A path of file containing JSON data 
is the positional argument of the script.

To run script on Linux:
```bash

$ python pprint_json.py test.json
[
    {
        1: 2,
        3: 4
    },
    {
        5:6
    }
]

```
Windows usage is the same.
